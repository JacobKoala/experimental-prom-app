# experimental-prom-app

This is the web "app" that was used by Wylie High School in 2019 to authenticate students at prom and prevent the resale of tickets. Until my school Google account gets deleted, you can see a live demo of the app at [experimental-prom-app.firebaseapp.com](https://experimental-prom-app.firebaseapp.com)

GitHub's security fixes may have broken the project. If you want to run this on your machine, you may want to reinitialize the project so Firebase will recreate the functions folder, or you may want to just use the latest release source (which has security flaws).

This project was created by a team of people, but I (Jacob Kotrla) wrote most of the server-related code, and I wrote the code that allowed the use of a webcam + selection menu for which webcam to use.
