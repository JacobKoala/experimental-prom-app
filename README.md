# experimental-prom-app

This is the web "app" that is used by Wylie High School (or at least *was* used by WHS in 2019) to authenticate students at prom and prevent the resale of tickets. Until my school Google account gets deleted, you can see a live demo of the app at [experimental-prom-app.firebaseapp.com](https://experimental-prom-app.firebaseapp.com)

GitHub's semi-automatic security fixes may have broken the project. If you want to run this on your machine, you may want to reinitialize the project so Firebase will recreate the functions folder, or you may want to just use the latest release source (which has security flaws).
