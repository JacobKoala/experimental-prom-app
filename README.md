# experimental-prom-app

This is the web "app" that is used by Wylie High School (or at least *was* used by WHS in 2019) to authenticate students at prom and prevent the resale of tickets. Until my school Google account gets deleted, you can see a live demo of the app at experimental-prom-app.firebaseapp.com
